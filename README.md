Tech

BabelChat uses a number of open source and other projects to work properly:

* [Meteor](http://wwwmeteor.com/) - A JavaScript platform built on [node.js](http://nodejs.org/) for building powerful real-tine apps
* [Google Translate API](https://developers.google.com/translate/) - With Google Translate, you can dynamically translate text between thousands of language pairs.
* [Twitter Bootstrap] - great UI boilerplate for modern web apps
* [jQuery]
* [underscore.js](underscorejs.org)
